# Arrays
This repository contains Java programs related to arrays, covering basic to intermediate concepts. Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in Java, and in this repo, I’ve implemented different types of array operations including creation, traversal, searching, sorting, and manipulation.

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate core Java logic-building skills, with clean code and proper comments. These programs are useful for beginners, college students, or anyone preparing for coding interviews.

All code is written in pure Java using simple syntax so it’s easy to understand and modify. This repo will be regularly updated with new problems and solutions related to 1D arrays, 2D arrays, and array-based algorithms.
